PZEM-004T and ESP8266 based power/energy meter: https://primalcortex.wordpress.com/2019/07/06/measuring-home-energy-consumption-with-the-pzem004t-and-esp8266/

The PowerMeter repository/folder contains the firmware for an ESP8266 and PZEM-004T based power/energy meter. This is the firmware that should be used to have a full functional ESP8266 based powermeter.
The PowerMeter is designed to use Wemos D1 ESP8266 boards.

The PZEM004T-Test repository contains a simple program for testing the ESP8266 to PZEM004 communications and the retrieving of data from the PZEM004T.
